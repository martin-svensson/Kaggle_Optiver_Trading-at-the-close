## Lessons from this compteition

Code structure
- WSL2 works well with VScode and python. It is nice to be able to use bash. Remember to create a project specific conda environment to which we can install whatever we need to the project (remember to conda activate the env)
- Kagge notebooks: Keep all functions and class definitions in a utility script, which can then be imported in notebooks. This makes the notebooks very clean, as all we do in the notebooks is apply functions and descrbie the process. (https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/product-feedback/91185)
